# Week 01 ‚Äì Engineering Concepts

Welcome to Week 1 of my Digital Nurture 4.0 Deepskilling journey.  

This week focused on strengthening **core Java concepts**, **design principles**, and **algorithmic problem-solving** through hands-on exercises.

## Design Patterns & Principles

### 1Ô∏è . Singleton Pattern ‚Äì Logger
- **Goal**: Ensure a single, globally accessible logger instance.
- **Highlights**:
  - Lazy Initialization
  - Controlled instance creation via `getInstance()`
  - Instance identity verified using `hashCode()`
- **Folder**: `DesignPatterns and Principles/SingletonPatternExample`

### 2Ô∏è . Factory Method Pattern ‚Äì Document Creator
- **Goal**: Abstract object creation logic using factory classes.
- **Highlights**:
  - Interface-based design
  - Separate factories for Word, PDF, Excel
  - Easily extendable for new types
- **Folder**: `DesignPatterns and Principles/FactoryMethodPatternExample`

## Algorithmic Thinking & Java Implementation

### 2. E-commerce Platform Search Function
- **Goal**: Implement efficient product search using Linear and Binary Search.
- **Features**:
  - CLI-based user input
  - Search by ID, Name, Category, and Price Range
  - Uses Builder pattern for object creation
- **Folder**: `Algorithms and Data Structures/E-commerce Platform Search Function`

### 7. Financial Forecasting (Recursion)
- **Goal**: Predict future investment value using recursive logic.
- **Features**:
  - Recursive calculation based on compound interest
  - Handles invalid input
  - Clean structure and real-time forecasting
- **Folder**: `Algorithms and Data Structures/Financial Forecasting`

##  Notes

- Java code is modular and follows OOP best practices.
- Handwritten notes and documentation are included in each section.
- Folder names reflect the actual problem domain for clarity and scalability.
- Reports are included as `.pdf` files for each major task.
